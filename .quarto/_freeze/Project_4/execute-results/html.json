Your code will automate the process of loading the data, performing operations on that data, and making it into a presentable format. \n\nWe will be aiming for two outcomes in this project. \n\n### Outcome 1 - total career summary statistics\n\nYou should end up with a output that contains the following information, presented as two text outputs:\n\n1) The name of the player. Harry Kane in this case\n2) The number of seasons played\n3) The total number of appearances\n4) The total number of goals scored\n5) The total number of goals and assists combined\n6) The average expected goals\n\n***\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Player: Harry Kane | Seasons: 15 | Appearances: 436\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Goals: 289 | Goals and assists: 351 | Average expected goals: 20.3\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n***\n\n### Outcome 2 - filtered dataset showing highest scoring years\n\nYou should end up with a output that shows a filtered dataset with some selected columns. \n\nYou will need to create the columns `goals_assists`, `goals_xg_diff`, `goals_no_pens` to get this output. \n\n***\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      season age         squad goals goals_assists goals_xg_diff goals_no_pens\n9  2016-2017  23     Tottenham    29            34            NA            24\n10 2017-2018  24     Tottenham    30            32           5.2            28\n13 2020-2021  27     Tottenham    23            37           2.9            19\n15 2022-2023  29     Tottenham    30            33           8.6            25\n16 2023-2024  30 Bayern Munich    36            44           5.4            31\n17 2024-2025  31 Bayern Munich    26            35           5.7            17\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n***\n\n### The data\n\nWe will be using the csv file provided (`harry_kane_stats.csv`). Click the link below to download the data. \n\n{{< downloadthis resources/harry_kane_stats.csv label='Download csv file' dname=project_4_data icon=folder-fill type=success >}}\n\nThe dataset provides general football metrics on each season Harry Kane has played, from 2010-2025. \n\nIf you are not sure what the expected goals and assists columns mean, you can find the definitions on [the statsperform webpage](https://www.statsperform.com/opta-event-definitions/), under the header *'Expected Goals & Expected Assists'*. \n\n## Steps to help you get to the outcome\n\n### Part 1 - the setup\nOpen an R script file and save it. Make sure to save the dataset in the same folder as your R script file. \n\n### Part 2 - load in the dataset\nImport the csv file into R. \n\nView the dataset you just loaded into R. \n\n### Part 3 - column calculations\nOur dataset is missing useful information about our players season statistics. Fortunately we can calculate these! \n\nCalculate the following metrics and add them as columns to your dataset.\n\n- Combined goals and assists per season  \n- Goals excluding penalties \n- Difference between goals scored and expected goals\n\n### Part 4 - calculating the total career statistics\nTo build our career summary we will need to create variables with the metrics we need by performing calculations on columns in the dataset. \n\n- The name of the player. Harry Kane in this case \n- The number of seasons played   \n- The total number of appearances \n- The total number of goals scored \n- The total number of combined goals and assists \n- The average expected goals \n\nThe metrics you produce should match what we see in outcome 1. \n\n### Part 5 - making career summary\nPrint out the multi line string message that shows you the career summary metrics.\n\n### Part 6 - filtering rows of a dataset\nSubset your dataset to only contain seasons where our players combined goals and assists where greater than 30. \n\nIt is good practice to assign the results of your subset to a new data frame under a different name. \n\n### Part 7 - selecting columns of a dataset\nSelect the columns, shown in the second outcome, to make your results more presentable. \n\nYou should be able to adjust the code you have written to select the columns. \n\n### Final task - fill out the survey!\n\n\nWe are always looking to improve and iterate our workshops.
