Your code will automate the process of taking data and making it into a presentable format. \n\n### Make a Celsius to Fahrenheit temperature converter {#sec-outcome}\n\nWe will write a programme that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit, and Fahrenheit to Celsius. It will then write out a helpful message. \n\nWe have two temperatures from a given time in London and New York. The London temperature is in Celsius, and the New York temperature is in Fahrenheit. In the outputs the numbers are rounded to zero decimal places. We are aiming for the following outputs: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n******\n\nThe temperature in London is 25째C, which is 77째F\n\nThe temperature in New York is 80째F, which is 27째C\n\n******\n\n## Steps to help you get to the outcome\n\n### Part 1 - the setup\nOpen an R script file and save it.\n\n### Part 2 - printing values\n\nPrint the value 25. \n\n\n### Part 3 - Celsius to Fahrenheit calculation\n\nTransform the value of 25 Celsius to Fahrenheit with this formula:\n\n$(Celsius \\times 9/5) + 32$\n\n### Part 4 - using variables\n\nStore the value of the temperature in Celsius (25) and print it using the stored value.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nThere are some useful resources online which can help you such as [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_variables.asp){target=\"_blank\"}.\n:::\n\n\n### Part 5 - calculations using variables\n\nUse the stored Celsius value to calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit. \n\nStore the outcome of this calculation and print it using the stored value. \n\n### Part 6 - more calculations\n\nStore the value of 80 Fahrenheit, then transforming 80 Fahrenheit to Celsius with this formula:\n\n$(Fahrenheit - 32) \\times 5/9$\n\nStore the the outcome of the calculation. Print the outcome using the stored value. \n\n### Part 7 - making a text output\n\nNow we can bring it all together to make our final output as seen in @sec-outcome. \n\nUse R to make the two text outputs by concatenating elements from one or more variables into a single string.\n\nThis should be automated, so if we change the variable for Celsius or Fahrenheit the code will show the new output. \n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\nYou can search online here, or use the built in help page in RStudio. \n\nFor example, the `paste()` function will help you here. Try running `?paste` to bring up the help page in RStudio. \n:::\n\n### Part 8 - tidy up\n\nRound the outputs to make sure we are looking at whole numbers only. You will need to assign this result to a variable to use in your output.  \n\n### Part 9 - try different temperatures\n\nTest out your code by converting different temperatures. \n\nChange your temperature variables to the following and re-run your code:\n\n- 10 Celsius as Fahrenheit  \n- 20 Fahrenheit as Celsius\n\n### What should my code look like?\n\nIdeally, your code should have at minimum four variables:\n\n- The London temperature in Celsius\n- The New York temperature in Fahrenheit\n- The London temperature converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit\n- The New York temperature converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius\n\nYou may have more such as variables for the text outputs you made. \n\n\n### Final task - fill out the survey!\n\nWe are always looking to improve and iterate our workshops.
