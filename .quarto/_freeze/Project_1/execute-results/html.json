Your code will automate the process of taking data and making it into a presentable format. \n\n### Make a Celsius to Fahrenheit temperature converter\n\nWe will write a programme that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit, and Fahrenheit to Celsius. It will then write out a helpful message. \n\nWe have two temperatures from a given time in London and New York. The London temperature is in Celsius, and the New York temperature is in Fahrenheit. In the outputs the numbers are rounded to zero decimal places. We are aiming for the following outputs: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n******\n\nThe temperature in London is 25째C, which is 77째F\n\nThe temperature in New York is 80째F, which is 27째C\n\n******\n\n## Steps to help you get to the outcome\n\n### Part 1 - The setup\n\nOpen an R script file and save it.\n\n### Part 2 - starting with calculations\n\nWhen working through a problem it is often sensible to break it down and start with something simple. \n\nUse R to calculate:\n\n- 25 Celsius as Fahrenheit  \n- 80 Fahrenheit as Celsius\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\nGo online and search for the conversion formulas for Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n:::\n\n### Part 3 - using variables\n\nUsing the calculations you made, create variables to store the temperature values and the calculated output values.  \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nThere are some useful resources online which can help you such as [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_variables.asp){target=\"_blank\"}.\n:::\n\n### Part 4 - making a text output\n\nNow we can bring it all together to make our final output. \n\nUse R to make the two text outputs by concatenating elements from one or more variables into a single string.\n\nThis should be automated, so if we change the variable for Celsius or Fahrenheit the code will show the new output. \n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\nYou can search online as before, or use the built in help page in RStudio to help you. \n\nFor example, the `paste()` function will help you here. Try running `?paste` to bring up the help page in RStudio. \n:::\n\n### Part 5 - tidy up\n\nUse a function to round the outputs to make sure we are looking at whole numbers only. \n\n### Part 6 - try different temperatures\n\nTest out your code with different temperatures. \n\nChange your temperature variables to the following:\n\n- 10 Celsius as Fahrenheit  \n- 20 Fahrenheit as Celsius\n\n\n### Final task - fill out the survey!\n\nWe are always looking to improve and iterate our workshops.
