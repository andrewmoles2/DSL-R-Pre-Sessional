If you are interested in using R Markdown see @sec-markdown. This video assumes you already have RStudio installed and open. \n\nWe are using **command/control + enter** to run the code in this video. \n\n![Video guide showing how to get setup for R workshop](images/RStudio_setup.mp4){fig-alt=\"A video guide taking you from the DSL R website, to the materials, going to RStudio, opening a R script file, running some code, then adjusting the theme or look or RStudio to suit your needs.\"}\n\nThe following sections give more information on R scripts and R Markdown documents, as well as setup instructions for the workshops. \n\n## Opening RStudio\n\nIf you have not done so already, open RStudio!\n\n### Windows users\n\n-   Type `RStudio` in the search bar (bottom left, next to windows symbol)\n-   If you prefer, open the start menu (click windows symbol), then scroll until you find RStudio\n\n### Mac users\n\n-   Hit command + space and type in `RStudio`\n-   If you prefer to look for RStudio in an applications folder (open finder and select Applications on the left panel), you should be looking for this icon: ![](images/rs.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio icon\"}\n\n### RStudio overview\n\nWhen RStudio opens you should see a layout with 3 panels, similar to the image below.\n\n![RStudio, image from 2023](images/rstudio.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio basic layout with three panels open\"}\n\nThe largest panel on the left with the `>` is the console. On the bottom right there is the files/plot panel, and top right is the environment panel.\n\nIf your installation of R and RStudio has worked, first RStudio should be open, and second you should see a message in your console panel telling you the version of R you have installed, like the image below.\n\n![R version displayed in RStudio console, image from 2023](images/r-version.png){fig-alt=\"Output that is shown in RStudio console when you open RStudio which shows the version of R\"}\n\nThere are three ways of running R code: the console, R scripts and R Markdown. In the R workshops we use R scripts, but R markdown can also be used if preferred.  \n\n## R Scripts\n\n::: callout-tip\n### What are R Scripts?\n\nAn R Script file is a text file that contains a set of commands, or code, written in the R programming language. They are simple to use, allowing you to save the code you have written for later.  \n\nAn in-depth description can be found in the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts.html){target=\"_blank\"} open source book.\n:::\n\n### Opening R Scripts\n\nIf you move your mouse/courser to the top of your screen you will see a banner with *file*, *edit*, *code* etc. \n\nTo start a new R script: go to `File > New File > R Script`, or use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl/command + shift + N`.\n\nTo open a saved R script: use `File > Open File...`, find the R script file to load. R script files have the extension `.R`.\n\n### Using R Scripts\n\nThe below image shows an R Script in action. \n\n![Image of R Script](images/R-script.png){width=\"90%\" fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"RStudio layout with script open and code run. Stored variables are shown in the environment panel\"}\n\nThere are two main ways of running code in an R Script. \n\n*   Use `ctrl/command + Enter` to run each line\n*   Highlight a section of code, and use the run button (or press `ctrl/command + Enter`)\n\nYou might notice code you have run appears on the console (bottom left), and if you make a variable that will appear in the Environment (top right). \n\n## R Markdown {#sec-markdown}\n\n::: callout-tip\n### What is R Markdown?\n\nAn R Markdown file has sections of text and code together in a single document. This is helpful for tutorials, documentation, and writing reports.\n\nAn in-depth description can be found in the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html){target=\"_blank\"} open source book\n:::\n\n### Opening R Markdown files\n\nOpening a R Markdown file is very similar to opening a file in other software. If you move your mouse/courser to the top of your screen you will see a banner with *file*, *edit*, *code* etc. \n\nTo start a new R markdown file:  go to `File > New File > R Markdown...`.\n\nTo load a R markdown file: Use `File > Open File...`, find the R Markdown file to load. R Markdown files have the extension `.Rmd`.\n\n\n### Using a R Markdown file\n\nThe image below shows the basic layout of a R Markdown document.\n\nThe top section (between the ---) is the *YAML* header which is used when making documents from R markdown.\n\nThe hash tags show headers, and below them is text. \n\nThe grey sections are where you write your code. \n\n![Image of R Markdown notebook, indicating the text and code sections](images/R-Markdown.png){width=\"90%\" fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"R Markdown layout where code cells are shown as grey sections with text around them\"}\n\nThere are three ways to run code in a code cell. The two ways mentioned in the image (Run and play button), and third is to use `ctrl/command + Enter` to run each line just like you would with an R script.\n\nThe most important thing for you to take note of is the code cells. Each code cell is like a small R script. You'll notice the \\`\\`\\` markings around the code cell. It is important these do not get deleted, so be careful when editing your code!\n\nA top tip is to change the mode of your R Markdown file from `source` to `visual` which provides a more pleasing environment to code in. To do this you will find the option near the ***top right of your RStudio window***. \n\nFinally, you can add your own code cell using `option+command+i` on a Mac or `ctrl + alt + i` on a Windows machine.\n\n::: callout-note\nIf you have struggled with any of these steps ask a trainer for support\n:::\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Video setup guide {#sec-video_setup}\n\nNote that this video demonstrates how to use scripts in R.
