To get there it is sometimes helpful to breakdown the process. \n\nTry first to a make an output for just the first hour, like the result below, using vector indexing to get the data you need. Then use string concatenation to bring all the information together to create a text output. \n\n`r paste(\"Temperature at \", hour[1], \": \",  temps[1], \"°C (\", temps_f[1], \"°F)\\n\", sep = \"\")`\n\n### Task 7 - finish the text output\nNow using the code you just wrote, iterate your code so you get the hourly weather report with both Celsius and Fahrenheit, as seen in @sec-outcomeone. \n\n### Task 8 - naming a vector\n\nUsing vector naming, add the hours vector as a name to the temperature vector.\n\n### Part 9 - filtering the temperature vector\n\nUsing boolean indexing, filter the temperature vector so we are only left with temperatures over 30°C. Your outcome should be the same as seen in @sec-outcometwo. \n\n### Part 10 - test your code with new data\nA good way to test out your code is to try it on different data. \n\nBelow we have the temperature data for a few days after the data we have been using.
